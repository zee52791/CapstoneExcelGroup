    "For our data capstone project we chose to examine the relationships between educational attainment and employment in the United States between the years of 2015 and 2020. In seraching for datasets relevant to our topic we found a wealth of information through the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS), the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics. Using a variety of conventional tools we cleaned the data we gleaned from government servers and transformed every dataset to suit our needs. In each section we will breifly introduce the dataset we are interested in exctracting followed by an discussion of the cleaning steps involved with code provided to further illuminate our data transformation process."

    "Now that we have successfully filtered out the inner index and raw data, we will turn our attention to the middle and outer indicies. For each item in our initial breakout groups list, we can find our outer index at list indicies, $i$, where $$i \\in 1 + 4 \\mathbb{Z}.$$ As well we find that our middle indicies are located at list index, $j$, where $$j \\in \\{ \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} - \\{1 + 4\\mathbb{Z}\\}  \\}.$$ We also observe that for each index in the source CSV file that, although each breakout group has a variable number of years included in the dataset, the year data is periodic with respect to the year 2019. This means that if we know that the next item in our inner index list is 2019 our break out group needs to change. Keeping in mind that becuase we will be using a multi-index for the resulting pandas dataframe, meaning that length and position matter, in light of both of these observations, we can now construct a for loop which will append items to a middle index and outer index list corresponding to their breakout group index value modulo four which will shift values when the next year added is 2019."
