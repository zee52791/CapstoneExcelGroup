Of those who reported only one race, being Hispanic was reported by 16.6 percent of White householders, 5.6 percent of Black householders, 2.9 percent of Asian householders and and 29.7 percent of American Indian and Alaska nanative householders. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population and for race groups because these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and recency of immigration. Data were first collected for Hispanics in 1972.\",',\n",

This means that if we know that the next item in our inner index list is 2019 our break out group needs to change. Keeping in mind that becuase we will be using a multi-index for the resulting pandas dataframe, meaning that length and position matter, in light of both of these observations, we can now construct a for loop which will append items to a middle index and outer index list corresponding to their breakout group index value modulo four which will shift values when the next year added is 2019."
